# Credit_Risk_Prediction

üìå Project Overview
- This project focuses on building a Credit Risk Prediction model using Lending Club loan data from 2014 to 2018. 
- The goal is to identify whether a borrower is likely to default or not, helping financial institutions reduce risk and improve decision-making.

üìÇ Dataset
- Source: Lending Club Loan Data (2014‚Äì2018)
- Target Variable: loan_status (binary ‚Äî defaulted or not)

üîß Preprocessing Steps
- Data Cleaning
- Dropped columns with more than 50% missing values.
- Handled remaining missing values using appropriate imputations.

üìÖ Feature Transformation
- Converted datetime features (like issue_d, last_pymnt_d) into meaningful numeric representations (e.g., number of months since issue).
- Applied encoding to categorical features, including:
- Weight of Evidence (WoE) transformation for monotonic relationship with the target.
- Information Value (IV) calculated to measure feature importance.
  
‚ùå Multicollinearity Handling
- Removed highly correlated features (VIF > threshold) to avoid multicollinearity issues.

‚≠ê Feature Importance
- Applied SelectFromModel using a Random Forest classifier to select top features based on importance scores.
